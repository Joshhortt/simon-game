# Simon-Game

_By **Josh Hortt**_

## Summary

This is an interactive Simon Game written in JQuery/CSS/HTML to simulate the classic Simon Electronic Memory Game.

## Getting Started

This game is written in JavaScript with some ES6 and JQuery library features used.

### Game Rule
Each level will have different set(s) of button blink, player must follow the order of how the button blink and click the corresponding button in order. If all buttons were click correctly, player will enter next level and have a more complex set of challenge as the game progresses to higher levels. Good luck! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

# Instructions

- Press any key to start the game

- Follow the sequence dictated by the game

- If you succeed, you will go on to the next level

- If you fail, the game will end

- But you can always start a new one by pressing any key again! ;)
